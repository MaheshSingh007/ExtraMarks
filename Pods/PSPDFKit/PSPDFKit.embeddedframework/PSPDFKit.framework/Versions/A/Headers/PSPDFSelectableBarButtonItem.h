 Use this class to configure the `PSPDFSelectableBarButtonItem` appearance.
 
 The recommended way to set the `PSPDFSelectableBarButtonItemView` `tintColor` is by setting
 the tintColor property on the parent `UINavigationBar` / `UIToolbar`. This will enable you to
 quickly set the same tint color for all your UIBarButtonItems. 
 
 You can also customize `PSPDFSelectableBarButtonItemView`'s tintColor
 directly or via `UIViewAppearance` to achieve a different look for `PSPDFSelectableBarButtonItem`s.
